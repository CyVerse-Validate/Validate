Ran into error running multiple requests on Pipeline.  Opened a second terminal tab and submitted a second job.  Job returned:

    requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Bad Request

and then first tab killed the polling with error:

    Begin polling... 1 remaining.
    Traceback (most recent call last):

Check jobs status on first submission and still pending.  Second Pipeline submission affected polling.  Must be from using one Agave account.

Cannot submit job in a different terminal tab.

Tried submitting in same tab as first job and received error:

    requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 400 Client Error: BAD REQUEST

Closed and reopened terminal session and still getting same error.

LMM runs with no-winnow without errors.  Does not copy files into Validate directory that was created.

Ridge is not currently available

Tried to run winnow without gwas ( no informat no filetype and --no_gwas option); Submission finished but no results

Status of parameter options
